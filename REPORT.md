## Problem our Bot solves

Following are the problems that our Bot Solves: 
1) Deploying Configurations of Remote Virtual Machines which otherwise would have to be done manually thus saving time and efforts of DevOps Engineers.
2) A centralized UI(Slack) to interact with all the Virtual Machines. The engineers won't have to SSH into the individual Virtual Machines and thus reduces complexity. 
3) Ability to shrink under-utilized Virtual Machines. Thus we achive efficient utilization of the resources in our remote server.  
4) Ability to merge two virtual machines on package level to spin up a new virtual machine, that has union of packages from both original virtual machine. So that DevOps engineers do not have to spend time on installing all the packages from two vitual machines manually.  

## Primary features and screenshots:
  
Primary features of the bot are:  
1) Users can execute ansible commands on an AWS server and perform operations like spinning up configurable virtual machine instances, getting list of instances running on the AWS server and getting uptime for the ansible tower.  
2) Ability to merge two virtual machines running on the server by merging their respective list of packages and creating a new virtual machine with merged packages.  
3) Ability to shrink a virtual machine instance on the server to a lower configurable instance such that there is optimum resource consumption by virtual machines.  
  
  _Use Case 1: Execute Ansible Commands on AWS server_  

1) Users can get the uptime of the Ansible Tower by executing the below command:

    `firecommand uptime`
    
    _For Example:_

2) Users can get the list of running instances on AWS server using the below command:

    `firecommand ansible --list-hosts`
    
    _For Example:_  
    
    <img width="1227" alt="screen shot 2017-12-03 at 3 16 51 pm" src="https://media.github.ncsu.edu/user/6108/files/f5744bd2-d842-11e7-9753-113bca7d6aaa">


3) Users can spin up configurable virtual machines using pre-written ansible playbooks. To spin a virtual machine named 'vm1' on the server below command can be executed:  

    `firecommand ansible-playbook AnsiblePlaybooks/vm1.yaml`
    
    _For Example:_  
      
      <img width="1238" alt="screen shot 2017-12-03 at 3 15 56 pm" src="https://media.github.ncsu.edu/user/6108/files/c2820b42-d842-11e7-8df9-a918004efd59">
    
    On AWS server:

_Use Case 2: Merge virtual machines on Package Level_

1) Users can get the list of packages that will be installed in the merged virtual machine after combining packages of two virtual machines using the below command:  

    `merged_version vm1 vm2`
    
    _For Example:_  
    
    <img width="1234" alt="screen shot 2017-12-03 at 3 17 49 pm" src="https://media.github.ncsu.edu/user/6108/files/88dc334e-d843-11e7-993a-c92b62ceb172">

    
2) Users can merge two virtual machines if they're satisfied with the merged list of packages using the below command:  
  
    `merge vm1 vm2 vm3`
    
    _For Example:_  
    
    <img width="1219" alt="screen shot 2017-12-03 at 3 31 03 pm" src="https://media.github.ncsu.edu/user/6108/files/9a58d0b4-d843-11e7-889a-6500cbbcf760">

    On AWS server:
    <img width="1384" alt="screen shot 2017-12-03 at 3 30 20 pm" src="https://media.github.ncsu.edu/user/6108/files/5ac2cd0a-d844-11e7-8248-b0e1ff47b5f8">


_Use Case 3: Shrink a virtual machine on AWS Server_

1) CloudWatch CPU utilization metrics are used to evaluate which of the running instances can be shrinked. Users can get the list of instances that can be shrinked on AWS server using the below command:  

    `list_shrinkable`
    
    _For Example:_  
    
    <img width="1229" alt="screen shot 2017-12-03 at 3 31 44 pm" src="https://media.github.ncsu.edu/user/6108/files/212437c8-d844-11e7-9775-1899386fcbf8">
    
2) Users can get the proposed configuration of the virtual machine after it is shrinked using the below:  
  
    `shrinked_version vm1`
    
    _For Example:_  
    
    <img width="1227" alt="screen shot 2017-12-03 at 3 32 04 pm" src="https://media.github.ncsu.edu/user/6108/files/c840be24-d843-11e7-9909-5a2276586eb8">

    
3) When the user has decided which virtual machine to shrink and is satisfied with the proposed instance configuration, they shrink a virtual m achine using the below command:  

    `shrink vm1`
    
    _For Example:_  
    
    <img width="1227" alt="screen shot 2017-12-03 at 3 32 48 pm" src="https://media.github.ncsu.edu/user/6108/files/d324c664-d843-11e7-8663-f90e4d1a58fb">  
    
    On AWS server:

## Some reflection on the development process of our project: 

The following are some of our reflections on the developement process of our project:

- The process started with initial brainstorming of the idea. All team members sat through and identified the various components of our project. Key components were identifies as Slack Bot, Javascript, Ansible, AWS, Networking aspects among others.
- Then we split, with each member assigned to various tasks to get more in depth knowledge on each of the above areas.
- Then all of us came together to share this knowledge and start the development process. Each person looked into each key aspect from development point of view. It was important to keep discussing among the group as several components needed integration.
- Each team memberâ€™s skills(strengths) were identified. Tasks were divided keeping the strengths in mind yet there was flexibility. Each task from there on was generally divided and assigned to 2 team members. One as primary and other secondary. 
- We used to make it a point to have frequent sync-ups so as to make sure we are not lagging in anyway. Also roadblocks were discussed among others in the project so the issue was resolved.
- Once we developed the basic functionality, all sat together to test it and then pin-point on things done right and more important those not done right. Improvements were suggested by all and then design decisions were revalidated.
- At all times a Git repo was maintained. Every person worked on their own branch and once code was tested, only then it was merged to Master.
- Testing was an integral part especially in the second half of the project since it was important to validate the bot and make sure it works as per design goals and solves problems in the real world.

## Limitations and Future Work: 

#### Below are known limitations of our system:
1. There is no security implemented as of now. We do not validate the malicious inputs. Also, we do not keep ACL(Access control list) of who can do what?
2. The AWS credentials are not put in the deployment script for security purposes. Thus we had to do a manual work for this.
3. We do not allow editing YAML files through the chatbot directly.

#### Below are proposed future work:
1. Provide summary features to bot. 
2. Bring more autonomy to bot through tracking various aspects of VMs.
3. Enable the system to manage user access and privileges.
4. Whitelist commands allowed to be executed on Ansible tower.
5. Make SSH credential available through the chatbot for created instances.
6. Add functionality to edit or upload a YAML file/playbook to Ansible tower.
